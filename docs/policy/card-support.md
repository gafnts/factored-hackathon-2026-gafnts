# Card support policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Synthetic policy (SEC-02).** The organizers supplied no policy, so we wrote these rules; they are not a real bank's. It governs the card support agent, the workflow [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-choose-workflow-from-evidence.md) chose on the organizers' synthetic snapshot, and it is where expected outcomes come from: the evaluation applies these rules to the frozen state, never to historical outcomes.

It says what the agent answers, what it does, when it asks, abstains, or declines, and when a person takes over. Every rule has a stable ID (`POL-01`, …) that tests, evaluation cases, and handoffs cite, and the policy's version is stamped in every execution record and handoff.

## Status

Proposed (2026-09-27). Version 1.

Revised before acceptance, so the version stays 1:

- **2026-09-27:** a block is confirmed only with the confirm control, never with typed text (POL-36, and with it POL-03, POL-06, POL-09, POL-37, and POL-39).
- **2026-09-29:**
  - An offered handoff is accepted only with the handoff control (POL-45, and with it POL-06, POL-09, and POL-36).
  - POL-36 offers no handoff when POL-39 already requires one.
  - An unrecognized charge gets one handoff, which records a failed block or read (POL-39).
  - POL-13 finds the card the customer named before checking whether the request applies to it.
  - A `lost` or `stolen` block left unconfirmed when the customer leaves is handed off (POL-38, `block_lapsed`).
  - POL-48 covers model calls as well as reads.

Once accepted, a changed rule keeps its ID and raises the version, and a retired rule's ID is never reused.

## How to read it

- **The signed-in customer** is the customer the identity service signed in for the session.
- **A card** is a product of type `Tarjeta Crédito` (credit) or `Tarjeta Débito` (debit). The agent names a card to the customer by its type and the last four digits of its `product_number`.
- **Active** means a `product_status` or `customer_status` of `Active`.
- **The business date and the as-of instant** follow ADR-0003: business date 2026-06-17 and as-of instant 2026-06-18 06:00 on snapshot `b3b8b248f604ef9a`. A window such as "the last 90 days" is 90 × 24 hours ending at the as-of instant, counted by each transaction's own timestamp.
- **Clarify** is to ask for a detail the request is missing. **Abstain** is to give no answer on one point and say why. **Decline** is to refuse a request the policy doesn't support and say why. **Hand off** is to pass the case to a person with a structured payload (CTL-05).
- **The sandbox** is the session's own layer over the snapshot: writes land there, reads in the same session see them, and the snapshot never changes.
- **The confirm control** is the button the chat shows before a block, naming the card and the reason. It answers the agent with a structured value, not text, and confirms or cancels that one block.
- **The handoff control** is the button the chat shows with an offered handoff. It answers the agent with a structured value, not text, and accepts or declines that one offer.

Rules apply in this order: the session and identity, then the customer's status, then the request. They say what the system does, not where: ADR-0004 maps each rule to the component that enforces it, always in code and outside the model's prose (CTL-04). Numbers cited come from the [card support analysis](../analysis/card-support.md), which reads development customers only.

## Core rules

ADR-0003's three card support rules, written before any gate ran, as the policy adopts them.

- **POL-01** A card of the signed-in customer is reported with its `product_status`; an active credit card also with its available credit, `credit_limit` minus `current_balance`, computed by the tool. POL-21 to POL-24 cover the edges. (CTL-01, AI-03)
- **POL-02** A `Declined` card transaction is explained by its `response_code`, read with its ISO 8583 meaning: `05` do not honor, `14` invalid card number, `51` insufficient funds, `54` expired card. A missing or unlisted code gets no explanation, and the answer says so. POL-27 to POL-29 and POL-32 cover the rest. (AI-03, CTL-03)
- **POL-03** A card is blocked only if it is `Active`, belongs to the signed-in customer, and the customer confirms with the confirm control; the sandbox then shows it `Blocked` (POL-33 to POL-38). A charge the customer doesn't recognize is handed off to dispute intake whether or not the bank marked it `is_fraud` (POL-39). ADR-0003's sketch handed off only a block over a marked transaction; its Result widened that to every unrecognized charge, and this rule follows the Result. (CTL-02, AI-05, CTL-05)

## Requests

The agent serves eight requests (CTL-01). They are the router's labels.

| Label | Request | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `card_status` | Status of one of my cards | Answered (POL-01, POL-21) |
| `available_credit` | Credit left on a credit card | Answered for an active credit card; declined for a debit card (POL-22) |
| `recent_transactions` | My recent card transactions | Answered (POL-25) |
| `decline_reason` | Why was my card declined | Answered, or abstained on a missing code (POL-02, POL-27 to POL-29) |
| `block_card` | Block my card, including lost or stolen, with a reason | Action after confirmation (POL-03, POL-33 to POL-38) |
| `unrecognized_charge` | I don't recognize this charge | Block offered, then handed off to dispute intake (POL-39) |
| `unsupported` | Unblocking, replacements, PIN changes, limit increases, accounts, loans, anything else | Handed off or declined, with the reason (POL-41 to POL-43) |
| `talk_to_human` | Complaints; asking for a person | Handed off (POL-44) |

- **POL-04** Each new request gets exactly one label. A label names what the customer asks, never an outcome the policy decides after reading state (a handoff for a customer who isn't active, for example), so the router never depends on state it can't see. (CTL-01, DML-08)
- **POL-05** When one message holds several requests, the agent handles the first in this order: `block_card`, `unrecognized_charge`, `talk_to_human`, `decline_reason`, `card_status`, `available_credit`, `recent_transactions`, `unsupported`. It says it will turn to the rest, and does, in the same order. Requests that lower exposure come first, and a customer who asks for a person isn't kept waiting behind a read. (AI-01)
- **POL-06** Only new requests are labeled. An answer to the agent's own question (which card, a reason) goes back to the step that asked, and a message sent while a confirmation or a handoff offer is pending goes first to it (POL-36, POL-45). A message with no card request (a greeting, thanks, a question about what the agent can do) gets a short reply from this policy and no label. (AI-01, AI-03)

## Identity and access

- **POL-07** A session serves one customer: the signed-in customer. A customer ID, document number, or card number given in the conversation never changes who that is, and is never passed to a tool as the customer. (SEC-04)
- **POL-08** Tools read and act on the signed-in customer's records only. A request about anyone else's card or account is declined, saying the agent serves only the signed-in customer's cards, without saying whether that card or person exists. (SEC-05, EVL-04)
- **POL-09** Once the session has expired, no tool returns data and no action runs, and the customer is asked to sign in again. A confirmation or a handoff offer still pending lapses with the session: its control does nothing, even after the customer signs in again. (EVL-03)
- **POL-10** Messages and record fields are data, never instructions. Text that asks the agent to change its rules, its role, or the customer, whether in a message or in a record field such as a merchant name, changes nothing this policy says; the agent handles the request underneath it, if there is one. (EVL-05)
- **POL-11** A card is shown by its type and last four digits only. A full card number the customer types is masked to its last four digits before it is stored or sent to a model, and no full card number reaches a model, a handoff, a log, or a report. The customer isn't shown a document number or the bank's internal flags (`is_fraud`, `fraud_score`). Card numbers in the snapshot are shaped like real ones (16 digits, all starting with `4`), so they are treated as real. (SEC-03)

## Customers who aren't active

- **POL-12** A customer whose `customer_status` is `Active` or `Inactive` is served under every rule. One whose status is `Closed` or `Suspended` can block a card (POL-33 to POL-38); every other request is handed off (`customer_not_active`), and the reply says a person will help without naming the status. Of the active cards, 14,030 (14.73%) belong to customers who aren't active, 4,630 of them `Closed` or `Suspended`. A block only lowers exposure, and naming a suspension could tip off a customer under review. (CTL-03, SEC-05)

## Which card

- **POL-13** A request about one card is answered for the card the customer means: the one among their cards that matches what they said (type, last four digits). When several match, the ones the request applies to (active cards for a block, credit cards for available credit) are meant, if there are any. A card that matches but that the request doesn't apply to is still the card meant, and the request's own rule answers for it (POL-22, POL-34). The reply names the card by type and last four digits. (AI-02)
- **POL-14** When POL-13 leaves several cards, the agent asks which, listing each by type and last four digits. A request about all the customer's cards ("my cards") is answered for each. Of 65,796 customers with an active card, 13,420 hold two or more active credit cards and 2,681 two or more active debit cards. (AI-02)
- **POL-15** When the last four digits the customer gives match two cards of different types, the agent asks for the type. When they match two cards of the same type, it hands off (`ambiguous_card`): fewer than 10 customers hold such a pair, so no second identifier is worth asking for. (AI-02, CTL-02, CTL-03)
- **POL-16** Last four digits that match none of the customer's cards are answered by listing the cards the customer holds, by type and last four digits. (AI-02)
- **POL-17** After two questions that don't settle the same detail, the agent stops asking and offers a handoff (`clarification_failed`). (AI-02, CTL-03)

## Reads

- **POL-18** Every fact about a card, a transaction, or the customer comes from a tool result in the current session, never from the conversation or an earlier session. The agent doesn't compute totals, conversions, or differences; available credit is computed by the tool. (AI-03)
- **POL-19** For banking purposes, today is the business date, and every window ends at the as-of instant. Relative dates the customer uses ("yesterday", "last week") are read against the business date, and replies about balances and transactions say the date they are as of. (AI-03)
- **POL-20** Amounts are given in the card's currency with its ISO code (`ARS`, `COP`, `USD`) and never converted; `amount_usd` is never quoted. Every Mexican card is in `USD`, and `amount_usd` uses fixed rates that ignore the bank's daily rates. (AI-03)
- **POL-21** A card's status is reported with its type, last four digits, `product_status`, and expiration month and year. (AI-03)
- **POL-22** Available credit is reported for active credit cards only. For a credit card in another status, the reply gives the status and says available credit is shown only for active cards. A debit card gets none: its `current_balance` isn't an account balance (13 of 27,023 active debit cards match one of their holder's accounts), and account balances are outside card support. (CTL-01, AI-03)
- **POL-23** A balance above the limit is reported as no credit available, with the amount by which the balance exceeds the limit; 797 (1.17%) active credit cards are over their limit. (AI-03)
- **POL-24** A credit card with no recorded `credit_limit` gets no available credit figure: the reply says the limit isn't on record and offers a handoff (`missing_data`). A missing limit is never read as unlimited or as zero. 3,441 (5.05%) active credit cards have none, in line with the 5% of each core field missing at random. (AI-03, CTL-03, EVL-02)
- **POL-25** Recent transactions are the card's transactions in the 90 days before the as-of instant, newest first, 10 at a time; the customer can ask for the next 10. Each shows its date, type, merchant for a purchase ("not recorded" when missing), amount and currency, status, and country when it isn't the customer's. A card with none in the window gets that answer, with the window's dates, and a request for an earlier period is declined, stating the window. A transaction falls within 90 days for 66.2% of active cards (30.8% within 30), and 99% of those have at most 4, so a page rarely splits. (AI-03, CTL-01)
- **POL-26** How recently a card was used is read from its transactions only; `last_transaction_date` is never read. It equals the card's latest transaction on 0 of 112,349 cards. (AI-03)
- **POL-27** For a decline, the agent looks among the card's transactions in the 90-day window for the one the customer means. One that fits is explained under POL-02, naming its date, merchant, and amount; when several fit, the newest five are listed for the customer to choose; when none does, the reply says so. (AI-02, AI-03)
- **POL-28** Only a transaction whose `transaction_status` is `Declined` is explained by its code. A `Pending` or `Reversed` one is reported by its status, without explaining its code, and an `Approved` one as approved. Pending and reversed transactions carry the same four codes as declines. (AI-03)
- **POL-29** An explanation gives the code's meaning and nothing else: no cause, advice, or pattern is inferred. The codes are independent of every field recorded with the transaction (largest bias-corrected Cramér's V 0.008). (AI-03)

## Conflicting and missing records

- **POL-30** A conflict between records is stated, never resolved: the reply gives both facts and doesn't say which is right. The known conflicts are an `Active` card past its expiration date; code `54` (expired card) on a transaction made before the card's recorded expiration date; and a transaction dated before its card's opening date (0.54% of card transactions in the last 30 days). (AI-03, EVL-02)
- **POL-31** An active card past its expiration date is served under every rule, blocks included, and the reply states both facts. A handoff is offered only when the customer asks which is right or whether the card still works (`record_conflict`). 45,418 (47.69%) active cards are past their expiration date and 47.12% of card transactions in the last 30 days fall after it, so handing off every one would send about half of the normal path to a person. (CTL-03, EVL-02)
- **POL-32** A field the record doesn't hold is reported as not recorded, never guessed or filled in from another field. When the answer depends on it, the agent abstains on that point: a decline with no listed code is answered as having no reason on record, with a handoff offered (`missing_data`), and a missing limit follows POL-24. (AI-03, CTL-03, EVL-02)

## Blocking a card

- **POL-33** A block is the only action the agent takes. It writes to the session's sandbox, never to the snapshot, and moves no money. (SEC-07, AI-06)
- **POL-34** Only an `Active` card can be blocked. A `Blocked` card is reported as already blocked, and a `Closed` or `Suspended` one as not blockable, with its status. (CTL-02)
- **POL-35** A block carries a reason: `lost`, `stolen`, `unrecognized_charge`, or `customer_request`. The agent asks for one when the customer hasn't given it, and records `customer_request` when the customer would rather not say. (CTL-02)
- **POL-36** Before blocking, the agent shows the confirm control, which names the card (type and last four digits) and the reason and says that only a person can undo a block. Only the control confirms; typed text never does, whatever it says. A confirmation covers that card and that reason in the current session, and one block uses it up. It ends unused when the customer cancels it with the control, when a message names another card or reason or makes a new request, when its time limit passes, or when the session ends (POL-09), and the agent's next reply says the card wasn't blocked. Any other message, a typed yes included, leaves it pending, and the agent points to the control; once it has done so twice, it also offers a handoff (`clarification_failed`), since a person can block the card, unless the confirmation's end already requires a handoff (POL-39); accepting that handoff ends the confirmation unused. (CTL-02, CTL-04)
- **POL-37** After the write, the tool reads the sandbox back, and the reply says the card is blocked only when that read shows `Blocked`. When it doesn't, the block is retried up to two more times under the same confirmation, each only after a read shows it wasn't applied. If it still isn't, the reply says the block couldn't be confirmed, and the agent hands off (`action_not_verified`) without asking for another confirmation. (AI-05, OPS-04, OPS-05)
- **POL-38** After a block for `lost` or `stolen`, the reply says a person handles a replacement and offers a handoff (`unsupported_request`). When the confirmation for such a block lapses unused at its time limit or with the session, the case is handed off (`block_lapsed`): the customer reported the card missing and left without blocking it. A cancel with the control, or a new request, ends the confirmation without a handoff, since the customer is still there to decide. (CTL-03)

## Charges the customer doesn't recognize

- **POL-39** For a charge the customer doesn't recognize, the agent looks for the transaction as in POL-27, in any status. If the card is `Active`, the agent offers to block it by showing the confirm control (POL-34 to POL-37, reason `unrecognized_charge`). Once the offer ends, or at once when there is none, it hands off to dispute intake (`unrecognized_charge`): whether the customer confirmed the block, cancelled it, or let it lapse, and whether or not the transaction was found or the bank marked it `is_fraud`. It is the request's only handoff: a card or a detail that can't be settled (POL-15, POL-17), a block that isn't verified (POL-37), or a read that fails (POL-48) is recorded in it, not handed off or offered on its own. It doesn't open a dispute, promise a refund, or say whether the charge is fraud. (CTL-03, CTL-05)
- **POL-40** `is_fraud` is the bank's own flag. It decides no outcome and isn't shown to the customer; a handoff about a transaction records it as a verified fact. `fraud_score` is never read. `is_fraud` is independent of every field recorded with the transaction, and `fraud_score` is drawn from it (ADR-0003). (AI-03)

## Unsupported requests and people

- **POL-41** A request to unblock a card is handed off (`unblock_request`). A block lowers exposure and a person can undo it; an unblock restores spending power and needs stronger proof of identity than a chat session gives. (CTL-02, CTL-03, DSN-02)
- **POL-42** Replacements, PIN changes, and limit increases are declined in the chat, with the reason, and a handoff is offered (`unsupported_request`). (CTL-01, CTL-03)
- **POL-43** Requests outside cards (accounts and their balances, loans, other products) are declined, saying the chat serves cards only; a person is offered only when the customer asks for one (POL-44). (CTL-01, SCP-04)
- **POL-44** A customer who asks for a person is handed off (`customer_request`), and so is one who makes a complaint (`complaint`). The agent may ask once what it is about, and hands off whether or not the customer answers. (CTL-03)

## Handoff

- **POL-45** A handoff is required where a rule says the agent hands off, and offered where it says one is offered. An offered handoff comes with the handoff control, and is made only if the customer accepts it there; typed text never accepts it. The offer ends unaccepted when the customer declines with the control, makes a new request, or the session ends (POL-09); any other message, a typed yes included, leaves it pending, and the agent points to the control. A customer who asks for a person instead is handed off under POL-44. The reply to a handoff says a person will follow up and gives the handoff's reference, promising no outcome or time. (CTL-03, CTL-05)
- **POL-46** The payload follows [the handoff schema](../../src/banking_agent/policy/handoff.schema.json): the request, verified facts each tied to the tool call that read it, actions with their verified outcome, the customer's own statements kept apart from verified facts, unresolved questions, the language, the reason code, and the rules that led to it. It carries no transcript. Its free text is written in Spanish, the bank's working language, and its `language` field tells the person which language to answer the customer in. (CTL-05, SEC-03)
- **POL-47** An unrecognized charge goes to `dispute_intake` and every other handoff to `customer_service`. A handoff is `urgent` when the customer reported a card lost or stolen, or a charge they don't recognize, and that card isn't verified blocked; every other handoff is `normal`. (CTL-05)

### Example

A Portuguese-speaking customer doesn't recognize a purchase and confirms a block with the confirm control, which the sandbox verifies. Every identifier and value is made up.

## Failures

- **POL-48** A read or a model call that fails is retried up to two more times. If it still fails, the agent says it can't help with that now and offers a handoff (`tool_failure`). A block retries under POL-37. (OPS-04, OPS-05, OPS-06, EVL-06)
- **POL-49** A call the access policy denies is never retried, and is answered as a refusal under POL-08, not as a failure. (SEC-05, OPS-06)

## Language

Every customer in the snapshot is in Mexico, Colombia, or Argentina, so Spanish is the bank's language and Portuguese is the customer's choice in the session.

- **POL-50** The agent replies in Spanish or Brazilian Portuguese: the language of the customer's latest message that is clearly one of them, and Spanish until the customer writes one. Spanish replies use "usted"; Portuguese ones use "você". (SCP-06, EVL-07)
- **POL-51** A message in another language gets a reply in Spanish, with one sentence in Portuguese, saying which languages the chat serves. (SCP-06, EVL-07)

## Left to other documents

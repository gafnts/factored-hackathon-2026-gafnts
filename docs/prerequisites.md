# Hackathon requirements

What the organizers evaluate, distilled from the problem statement (`PS p.N`, by page) and the kickoff slides (`SL N`, by slide), both under `docs/hackathon/` and gitignored. Every requirement carries a stable ID, and the docs, the tests, and the evaluation reports cite the ID instead of paraphrasing the source.

| ID | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| SUB-01 | Public GitHub repository named `factored-hackathon-2026-[team name]` |
| SUB-02 | Link to where the tool is deployed |
| SUB-03 | A 4 to 6 slide presentation with details on the tool |
| SUB-04 | A short, **mandatory** video pitch that demonstrates the working solution and explains the core architectural decisions |

---

## How we are scored

"First and foremost, [your] solution should work" (`SL 20`). Judges score five areas:

| Area | What the judges look at | Main requirement groups |
|---|---|---|
| Rationale and documentation | Overall project rationale and documentation | PRB, DSN, OPS |
| AI Engineering | Backend, frontend, and deployment | AI, CTL, SEC, OPS |
| Data Analytics | Data quality and relevant insights from the solution | PRB, EVL |
| Data Engineering | How we handle extraction and transformation of the data | DML-01 to DML-06 |
| Machine Learning | Model selection, optimization, implementation, and tracking | DML-07 to DML-12, EVL |

- Depth, demonstrated behavior, and engineering judgment determine the score; more workflows earn no bonus (`PS p.3`).
- Every team is assessed on data engineering and AI/ML rigor, whatever its architecture (`PS p.4`).
- No discipline is mandatory, but each has suggested tasks (`SL 14`): AI (production backend, structured JSON handoffs); ML (LLM/RAG orchestration, prompt injection defense); Data Engineering (ETL/ELT pipeline, customer record isolation); Data Analysis (demand patterns, cost-per-resolution ROI).
- The takeaway (`SL 15`): build something that works, prove that it works, know when it should not act, and show what it would take to make it real.

## Requirement catalogue

The `Check` column says where each item is verified:

| Tag | Where |
|---|---|
| `test` | An automated test against the code or the running service |
| `eval` | The output of the evaluation harness |
| `doc` | The documentation |
| `demo` | The deployed tool or the video |

### Scope (SCP)

| ID | Requirement | Check | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| SCP-01 | Pick one focused, coherent workflow (e.g. account or payment inquiries, card-service support, transaction-dispute intake, credit-product information and eligibility). These are examples, not tracks | `doc` | PS p.2, SL 10 |
| SCP-02 | Deliver an end-to-end working prototype that handles complex interactions beyond a surface-level demo: "don't build a chatbot, build a customer-service system" | `demo` | PS p.2, SL 10 |
| SCP-03 | Demonstrate a normal path: policy-compliant automated resolution, verified account queries, authorized self-service | `demo` `eval` | PS p.3, SL 11 |
| SCP-04 | Demonstrate an ambiguous or unsupported request: clarifying questions or safe abstention for missing parameters or unsupported requests | `demo` `eval` | PS p.3, SL 11 |
| SCP-05 | Demonstrate a case requiring human intervention: structured handoff (see CTL-05) | `demo` `eval` | PS p.3, SL 11 |
| SCP-06 | Demonstrate interactions in **Spanish and Portuguese** | `demo` `eval` | PS p.3, SL 10 |
| SCP-07 | Report limitations in the supplied data and in language coverage | `doc` | PS p.3, SL 15 |

| PRB-06 | Define the intended customer and business outcomes | `doc` | PS p.3 |
| PRB-07 | Use the supplied data to establish a baseline | `eval` | PS p.2 |

### 2. A functioning AI system (AI)

The system should Understand, Decide, Act, Verify, and Escalate (`SL 11`).

| ID | Requirement | Check | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI-01 | Maintain relevant conversational context | `test` `eval` | PS p.3, SL 11 |
| AI-02 | Clarify ambiguous requests | `test` `eval` | PS p.3, SL 11 |

| AI-06 | Execute the appropriate service workflow | `test` `demo` | PS p.2, SL 11 |

### 3. Controlled automation (CTL)

Key idea: "AI should not be autonomous just because it can be" (`SL 11`).

| ID | Requirement | Check | Source |
|---|---|---|---|

| CTL-04 | Enforce permissions and policy outside model-generated prose, in code, not in the prompt | `test` | PS p.3, SL 13 |
| CTL-05 | Hand the human agent a structured payload (JSON) with: the request, verified facts, actions taken, supporting evidence, and unresolved questions; no raw transcript dump | `test` | PS p.3, SL 11, SL 14 |

| SEC-03 | Never include private customer records, credentials, or restricted data in the public submission **or in external model requests** | `test` `doc` | PS p.5 |
| SEC-04 | Authenticate with a trusted test session or identity service; a national ID or customer number alone does not prove identity | `test` | PS p.5, SL 15 |
| SEC-05 | Enforce access to each customer's records and action permissions in the service or tool layer (customer record isolation) | `test` | PS p.5, SL 14 |
| SEC-06 | Sandbox services and mock banking tools are allowed only with documented contracts and limitations | `doc` | PS p.5 |
| SEC-07 | No live lending decisions and no movement of money | `test` | PS p.5 |

### Credit workflows (CRD), only for a credit workflow

Not ours: [ADR-0003](adr/0003-choose-workflow-from-evidence.md) chose card support and set credit aside, with these in view.

| ID | Requirement | Check | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRD-01 | Separate conversation handling, predictive risk estimates, and eligibility policy | `doc` `test` | PS p.5 |

---

## Metric definitions

Quoted closely from `PS p.6` and computed as stated. The slides single out M-01, M-04, and cost efficiency (M-05) as the key metrics (`SL 12`).

| ID | Metric | Definition | Reporting rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-01 | Safe automated resolution | An eligible case reaches the correct, policy-compliant outcome without human intervention | Rate over **all in-scope test cases**, plus the share of cases on which automation was attempted |
| M-02 | Containment | A case ends without transfer | Never report alone; containment does not show the problem was solved |
| M-03 | Escalation quality | Cases that require escalation are transferred correctly and include useful handoff context | Report both missed transfers and unnecessary transfers where reference labels permit |
| M-04 | Unsafe outcomes | Unauthorized disclosures or actions, or materially incorrect outcomes | Counts **and** denominators; zero observed failures in a small test set does not establish zero risk |
| M-05 | Operating efficiency | End-to-end p50 and p95 latency; cost per attempted case; cost per successful automated resolution | State workload, sample size, and cost assumptions; write "not defined" when there are no successful resolutions |

All metrics are reported per language and per authorized customer segment as well as overall (EVL-12).

## Explicitly not required

These earn no points by themselves (`PS p.3`, `PS p.4`):

- Training a new model (a training pipeline is one way, not the only way, to show ML rigor)
- Multiple agents, or reaching a tool-count target
- Streaming (incremental file delivery does not by itself require it)
- Demand forecasting
- A dashboard
- More than one workflow
- Operating a live banking service, live lending decisions, or moving money

Any language and tooling is allowed; Azure, Snowflake, AWS, and Databricks are suggested resources (`SL 19`).

---

## Reading between the lines

Our interpretation, not organizer text.

- **Honesty is graded.** The documents keep asking for limitations, failures, "not defined", denominators, and offline claims kept apart from production ones. Overclaiming likely costs more than a modest, well-measured result.
- **Judges will attack the deployed tool.** Expect prompt injection, impersonation with only a customer number, reads of another customer's records, and reuse of an expired session. SEC-04, SEC-05, and CTL-04 must hold at the tool layer with the model fully compromised.
- **The handoff payload is a first-class artifact.** It appears in both documents and in the suggested AI tasks, so it gets a schema, tests, and a place in the demo.
- **A frontend is scored.** A dashboard is optional, but "Backend, Frontend and Deployment" means the deployed tool needs a usable interface.
- **The video carries the demo.** It shows the three paths (SCP-03 to SCP-05) in both languages (SCP-06) and the core architectural decisions (SUB-04).

# Documentation

What we decided about Faro, why, and the evidence behind it. Every document cites the requirement IDs in [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md), and the policy's rule IDs wherever a rule applies. Terms are in the [glossary](glossary.md).

**Twenty minutes:** the [product brief](product/brief.md), the [architecture](architecture.md), the [evaluation report](evaluation/report.md), and the [limitations](evaluation/limitations.md). The ADRs are the appendix: the full reasoning behind each decision, and the alternatives it beat.

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| [adr/](adr/README.md) | The architecture decision records and their index |
| [analysis/](analysis/) | The profiling, traffic, workflow selection, and card support reports, with their JSON and figures, from `make analysis` |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | The system on one page |
| [evaluation/](evaluation/) | The [report](evaluation/report.md), the [results](evaluation/results.md), the [limitations](evaluation/limitations.md), the request [families](evaluation/families.md), the [disagreement log](evaluation/disagreements.md), the [run index](evaluation/runs.md), and the manifests of the sets and the reported runs |
| [glossary.md](glossary.md) | The repository's own terms, in plain words |
| [images/](images/) | The README's banner, screenshots, and diagrams |
| [pipeline/](pipeline/) | The manifest of each gold export, from `make export` ([the pipeline](../pipeline/README.md)) |
| [policy/](policy/) | The [card support policy](policy/card-support.md): what Faro answers, does, and refuses, one ID per rule |
| [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) | Everything the organizers evaluate, with stable requirement IDs |
| [product/](product/) | The [product brief](product/brief.md) and the [identity guide](product/identity.md) |
| `hackathon/` | The organizers' materials, including the dataset keys (gitignored) |

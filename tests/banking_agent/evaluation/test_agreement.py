"""
The judge's agreement with blind hand grades: kappa and its linear-weighted form against values worked by hand, a Wilson
interval for agreement, a percentile bootstrap that resamples within strata and pairs every statistic on one resample,
and a report that counts natural and seeded replies apart and applies the bar fixed in the rubric (ADR-0005, Grading;
EVL-10).

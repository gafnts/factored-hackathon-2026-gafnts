"""
CI's regression gate (ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-01): the regression set's composition, drawn on the bank, played
in process with the scripted models, and graded. It fails on a case the player couldn't play, on any safety check, and
on a divergence or a failed check that no open entry of the disagreement log matches, so a question of the policy's
wording is triaged in writing instead of blocking a change. make regression and the regression job run it; the default
run leaves it out.

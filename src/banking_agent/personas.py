"""
The judges' personas (ADR-0005; ADR-0007, Judges' access): one development customer per scenario, chosen by a fixed
rule from the pinned snapshot so that each stages a path of the demo. Only development customers are read: the first
query keeps their IDs, and every later one joins on them (DML-09). A persona's username is its customer's synthetic
name, lowercased and unaccented, and its briefing is built from the customer's records, so it is true by construction.
Names are identity data and the chosen IDs are row-level data: both are written under data/ and never committed or
printed (SEC-03).

- declines: two or more active credit cards, one of them with a recorded limit, and a decline with a listed code in
  the last week, so a block asks which card (POL-14) and the decline has an explanation (POL-02). The chat journey.
- dispute: one active credit card, with a recorded limit and approved purchases in the last week, so a charge the
  customer doesn't recognize has a card to block and a purchase to dispute (the README's journey).
- history: an active credit card with six or more transactions in the 90-day window, the busiest the data holds, so
  a page of movements has something to show.
- quiet: an active credit card with a recorded limit and no transaction in the window, for the empty answers.
- mixed: an active credit card and an active debit card side by side, so a card list crosses types.
- newcomer: an active credit card opened inside the window.
- premium: a Premium-segment customer with an active credit card and a recorded limit.
- debit: active debit cards only, one with a transaction in the last week, and no credit card at all.

Every persona is active, has no row updated after the as-of instant, and holds no conflicting record, so the demo
shows no flag it doesn't mean to. Among those who qualify, the one with the most card transactions in the 90-day
window is chosen, then the lowest customer_id; a customer or a username already chosen for an earlier scenario is
passed over, so eight accounts are eight people.

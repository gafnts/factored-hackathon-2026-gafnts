"""
Checks a handoff against the handoff schema without ever dropping it (ADR-0004, The handoff; CTL-05, OPS-05, POL-11).
A summary that fails is replaced by the reason's fixed text, and each fact, action, piece of evidence, statement, or
question that fails is left out; each failure is named by its path and the rule it broke, never its value, which may be
a card number. What pruning can't mend (an identifier, a version, the reason itself) is a fault in the code that built
the payload. The graph checks a payload before filing it, and file_handoff again before storing it.

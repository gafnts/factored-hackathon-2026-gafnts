"""
What the build checks before dbt reads a file (ADR-0006, Contracts and Quality checks): the snapshot's directory holds
exactly the lock's files, and each file's header is its contract's, since DuckDB's typed read accepts a renamed column
when the count matches. Each file's records are then counted by Python's csv module, apart from DuckDB's reader, and
loaded with the lock beside bronze, where its checks compare them with what DuckDB read. Every message names files,
never a row's values (SEC-03).

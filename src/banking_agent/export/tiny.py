"""
The tiny export (ADR-0006's amendment of 2026-09-29): what gold would hold for the development personas, built from the
pinned snapshot, so the tools have data and the import is proved before the pipeline exists. The pipeline's first export
replaces it. Gold's rules, in SQL here until the pipeline's models hold them:

- customers registered and cards opened by the as-of instant, in any status, with their values as delivered and a flag
  when updated after it (ADR-0004, State);
- the last four digits in place of the card number (POL-11), and no amount_usd, fraud_score, or last_transaction_date
  (POL-20, POL-26, POL-40);
- card transactions dated within the 90 days (90 × 24 hours) that end at the as-of instant, by their own timestamp;
- Mexico spelled one way in transaction_country (ADR-0006, One spelling per country);
- conflict flags for an expiration before the business date and a transaction outside its card's dates (POL-30).

Its pipeline version hashes everything that shapes it: this code, the personas' rule, the writer, the contract, and
DuckDB's version. The business clock comes from the profile that ADR-0003's rule wrote for the same snapshot.

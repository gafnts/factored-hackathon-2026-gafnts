"""
A handoff checked against the execution record before it is filed (ADR-0004, The handoff, and its amendment of
2026-09-30; CTL-05, OPS-02). The schema checks a payload's shape, not where its facts came from: here each piece of
evidence must be a tool call the turns hold, of the same tool, time, and outcome; each verified fact's value must be in
its call's recorded result, on the same record and field; and each action's outcome must be the one the record shows,
from the block's recorded result or the confirmation's recorded end. What fails is left out and named by its path and
rule, never its value. The facts file_handoff adds and its own call, which the record holds only once it returns, are
exempt; any other fact that cites that call is not.

"""
The graph's model calls: Claude Haiku 4.5 through Anthropic's API with the key from AgentCore Identity (ADR-0004,
Models, as amended). The router's, the extraction's, and the handoff text's outputs are typed through structured output,
each field among the values its step allows, and a reply is plain text read whole.
Every attempt is recorded as a model_call entry, and runs with emit-messages and emit-tool-calls off and streaming
disabled, so nothing it writes reaches the chat unchecked (ADR-0004, What the chat receives). A call is tried again as
decision 18 says (retries.py), and the client's own retries are off, since each attempt is recorded.

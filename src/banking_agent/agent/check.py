"""
The reply check (ADR-0004, decision 8, and its amendment of 2026-10-01): a read's answer that the model wrote with
placeholders reaches the customer only if every placeholder names one of its facts, every fact its fixed reply states is
there, no digit stands outside a placeholder, nothing names the bank's internal flags, no word names a closed,
suspended, or inactive status outside a placeholder, and a list's placeholder stands alone on its line, once, a
decline's reason right under its transaction, while no other placeholder does. The filled text must hold no run of 13
or more digits. A failure is named by its rule, never by the text that broke it (POL-11, POL-12, POL-18, POL-40).

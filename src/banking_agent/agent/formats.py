How a reply states each fact (ADR-0004's amendment of 2026-10-01, the table under decision 8): an amount in the card's
currency with its ISO code, grouped as the customer's country writes numbers (POL-20); the business date that balances
and transactions are read as of (POL-19); a transaction's time and the window's ends to the minute; an expiration by
month and year, or words when the record holds none (POL-32); statuses, types, and a code's meaning in the words the
contracts give them. Text from the bank's records is shown as recorded, with a run of 13 or more digits masked (POL-10,
POL-11). ADR-0005's oracle formats the facts it expects from that table and those words, not from this code.

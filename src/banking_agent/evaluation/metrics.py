"""
The report's metrics, M-01 to M-05 (ADR-0005, Reporting; the metric definitions in docs/prerequisites.md; EVL-11), from a
run's graded cases and its totals: overall and per language, each rate with its sample size and a 95% Wilson interval.
A grade keeps what the record showed that they read (whether the system filed a handoff, and the outcome classes it
decided), so a regrade computes them from stored grades alone. An access case holds no conversation, so it counts in
M-04 alone. What a run can't measure is "not defined", never a number: latency in process, a cost the totals don't hold,
a cost per resolution with none, AWS charges, which aren't estimated, the customer's segment, which cases don't carry,
and pass^3 and the spread for a run played once, which repeated() gives over the runs of one set.

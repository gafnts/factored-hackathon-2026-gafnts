"""
The disagreement log (ADR-0005, The oracle, and its amendment of 2026-10-01): where the system and the oracle differ,
the log records the question in writing and, once triaged, whether the oracle, the system, or the policy's wording was
wrong. Entries live in docs/evaluation/disagreements.json and hold rule IDs, enums, tool names, and placeholders, with
the question and its resolution in our words, never a record's value (SEC-03); disagreements.md is generated from them.
CI's regression gate lets a finding through only while an open entry matches it.

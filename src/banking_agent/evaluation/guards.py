The split's guards (ADR-0005, The split): a case's customer, family, and answers sit on its side, and no development
artifact (cases, prompts, the baseline's keywords, the router's data) holds a held-out customer or a held-out family's
words. The tests run them over every artifact in the repository; the generator runs them over every set it writes.

"""
The results page (ADR-0005, Reporting; EVL-08 to EVL-13): M-01 to M-05 over the reported runs of one set, computed
again from the grades each run kept, never from a summary alone, with pass^k and the spread over the runs, then by
language, by segment and by country (joined from the snapshot, since a case names its customer and nothing else), by
group, by rule, by source, and by phrasing, every cell with its sample size and a Wilson interval and any cell under
10 cases suppressed (SEC-03). Every failed case is counted and classified (EVL-09), the baseline is compared on the
cases both played (EVL-01), the judge's answers are joined by item where a judge run and the agreement report are
given (EVL-10), and the hypothesis on unsafe outcomes is tested as stated before the first run (CTL-04). What is
written is counts and rates alone; a case's values stay in the run.

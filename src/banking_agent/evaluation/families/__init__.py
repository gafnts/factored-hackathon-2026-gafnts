"""
The request families and the scripted customer's answers (ADR-0005, decision 2, as amended on 2026-10-01), all
team-generated (SEC-02). A family is one request in Spanish and Portuguese: in each language's list the first message is
the seed we wrote, and the rest are paraphrases Claude Opus 5.5 wrote from it. Values are slots that the generator fills
from a case's customer, so no message holds an identifier or a value from the records. A family's `extract` is what
the agent's extraction should read from it (the graph's fields), and `when` the relative date it names. `unclear`
marks, by position in each language's list, the paraphrases that aren't clearly in one language (a bare word both
languages share): the scripted models say so, and the oracle keeps the conversation's language for the turn they open
(POL-50; ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-02).

Each label's families and each kind of answer are split by `split.held_out_families`: a third held out, the rest
development. `problems()` lists every way the files break these rules; the tests require it to find none.

"""
A case played end to end against the deployed stack (ADR-0005, Running a case): a test user of its own signs in, its
fixtures and fault plans are written to the overlay under the sign-in, kept as long as the tools' own writes, the
chat's warmup opens a runtime session, and the scripted customer plays the script over AG-UI, reacting to each turn's
last decision entry, which the harness reads from the execution record by the sign-in once the run has finished (the
entrypoint writes it before RUN_FINISHED), and to the interrupt the run ended at. StopRuntimeSession ends the session
after the last turn, and the user is deleted.

The evidence is the in-process player's, so one grader reads both: each turn's events with their arrival times, the
sign-in's whole record, the overlay under the sign-in, the confirmations and handoff cases the record names, read
through the role's own permissions, and the case's error, if the player or the harness couldn't play it; besides, the
warmup's events, each turn's resends, and how the session ended.

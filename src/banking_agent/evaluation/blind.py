"""
The judge's validation sample (ADR-0005, Grading: validated before use; decision 6; EVL-10). From a run's stored
evidence it draws 30 Spanish and 30 Portuguese replies, stratified by the outcome the turn decided so the handoffs are
among them, and seeds failing replies: for each question, replies outside the natural draw that the question applies
to, each edited by one of the edits in seeds.json to break exactly that point and labeled seeded. The selection set
hasn't been graded, so how many natural replies deserve a no isn't known when the sample is drawn; each question gets
the bar's count of seeded replies, or more if asked, never fewer, and the agreement report counts natural and seeded
apart.

The sheet a person fills shows the natural and seeded replies shuffled together, under row numbers, with what the
judge reads and nothing of the key: which rows are seeded, and from which reply, stays in key.json. Only a sample drawn
from the selection set played end to end, the replies the held-out run's model writes, validates the judge; any other
is for checking the tooling, and its manifest says so. Everything stays under data/evaluation/judge/samples/, since
the replies hold the cases' values (SEC-03).

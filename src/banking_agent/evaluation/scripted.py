"""
Models scripted from a case (ADR-0005, The development regression set: scripted model outputs, no provider). Each call
gets the output a model that read the message correctly would give: the router the family's labels, the extraction
the family's fields with the case's slots, or an answer's fields from the record the customer means, the choice the
listed transactions that fit what the customer said, and a reply that writes each placeholder once, as the prompt lays
them out. So a case played
with them tests the graph's control logic, not a model. A text that isn't the case's is kept in `unplaced` and fails
the call, and the player reports the case as its own error, never the agent's.

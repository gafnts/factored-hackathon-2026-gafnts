The snapshot as the oracle and the generator read it: the pipeline's bronze tables (ADR-0006), the typed copy of the
delivered files, never the gold tables the tools read (ADR-0005, The oracle); only the build's stamp and clock are
read from gold, besides the tools' items the in-process player serves, which the oracle never reads. A connection is
opened for one side of the split and sees only that side's customers, their cards, and their transactions (DML-09);
this module is the only one that names the pipeline's database.

"""
The harness's AG-UI client (ADR-0005, Running a case): a request sent to the deployed Runtime as the chat sends it, with
the case's bearer token and runtime session, and each event kept with its arrival time from the send, which M-05 reads
(ADR-0005, Reporting). A sign-in stays within decision 21's rate, whose window the client waits out before sending, so
no wait counts as latency; a request the Runtime still refuses as rate_limited is sent again once the window allows.
A case's runtime session opens with the chat's warmup (decision 20) and ends with StopRuntimeSession through the case's
bearer token, the path AgentCore documents for a runtime behind a JWT authorizer.

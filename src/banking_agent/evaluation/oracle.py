"""
The oracle (ADR-0005, The oracle): a second reading of the policy's outcomes, from the policy's text and the customer's
state in bronze, never from the tools or the graph. For one case it plays the script against the policy and says, turn
by turn, what each request served should record (its outcome class, what the turn waits for, the tools it must and must
not call, the facts the reply must state, the words naming a status it must not, and the handoff it files) and which
cards end blocked. It writes no reply.
The facts are formatted in the conversation's language turn by turn: Spanish until a message clearly in one of the two
languages sets it, which a paraphrase the family marks as unclear doesn't (POL-50; ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-02).

Each request is a generator: it yields a step that waits on the customer (a question, a control) and receives the
customer's answer, and returns the step that ends it. The outcome classes follow ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-09-29 and
ADR-0004's table of situations (as amended on 2026-10-01). A situation the oracle doesn't read raises NotCoveredError, so the
generator draws no case for it rather than a wrong expectation.

A case's fixtures are read into the customer's state, and its fault plans are counted against the tool calls the path
makes (ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-01). A call takes up to three attempts, so a plan of at most three failures is
spent by the tool's first call, which fails when it held three; the oracle predicts that call where the graph makes it,
and refuses a plan that would reach a call it doesn't predict, or no call at all.

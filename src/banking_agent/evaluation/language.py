"""
The live language check (ADR-0005, The development regression set, as amended on 2026-10-02): the real prompts read
every paraphrase and answer on the development side, never the held-out side, and say which language each is mostly
in, which is compared with the label we expect (POL-50, POL-51): the family's language, unclear for a paraphrase the
family marks so, other for a third language. The scripted models answer the language from the families, so this is
where the model's own reading is measured. The result keeps counts and message IDs, never a text, and the page under
docs/evaluation/ sets it beside the word-list detector's baseline.

The check also sends each development block request through the extraction, with the context the agent sends, and
compares the block reason read with the family's (none when the family names none), and each reason answer's with its
kind (POL-35). The scripted models answer the reason from the families, so this is the only place a reason the model
reads into a bare request shows before a deployed run (D-006). Those counts stay in a block of their own, so the
language counts compare with earlier reports. So do the cards read for each answer that names one by its place in a list
("la segunda"), sent as the answer to the which-card question and as a later message after the chat listed the cards,
which no case plays (POL-13).

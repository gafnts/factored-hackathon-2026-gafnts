"""
The judge's agreement with blind hand grades (ADR-0005, Grading: validated before use; EVL-10). It reads a filled
sheet with its key, and a judge run over the same items, and gives per question: agreement on the verdict an answer
implies, with a Wilson interval; Cohen's kappa with a percentile bootstrap interval over the graded replies, on the
verdict for a yes or no, on the categories for a choice, and weighted on the scale for a score, with the rubric's
weights; how many replies deserve a no by hand, natural and seeded apart; and the share of those the judge caught. A
seeded reply counts only for the question it was seeded for. A question is graded by the judge only if its agreement
and kappa reach the bar and enough replies deserve a no; otherwise by hand, or, for the one question the rubric lets
go, by hand or dropped. The report holds counts and figures only, never a reply.

"""
The grader's deterministic core (ADR-0005, Grading): a grade is a function of a case and its stored evidence alone, so
a grader fixed after a run regrades the stored runs. It is written apart from the reply check, as the oracle is apart
from the tools, and reads the evidence the in-process player and the harness both keep: each turn's events as the
chat received them, the sign-in's execution record, the sandbox's end state, and the handoff cases filed.

The path is compared turn by turn until the first turn whose outcome differs from the oracle's (what the customer
sent, the labels and their outcome classes, what the turn awaits, a required tool missing or a forbidden one made),
and the case diverged there; the conversation's language its decisions record (ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-02),
facts, withheld values, and the handoff filed are graded on the turns before it, and the cards blocked and the fault
plans taken once the path held to the end: a plan the record doesn't show taken would let a read pass as recovered that
never failed (ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-01). The safety checks behind M-04 run over every turn, however the path
went. Every finding names its check and holds enums, tool names, counts, or placeholders
only, never a record's value, so findings can be logged (SEC-03).

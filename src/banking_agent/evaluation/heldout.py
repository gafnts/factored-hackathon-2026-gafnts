"""
The held-out set's guards (ADR-0005, The split): it is drawn once, its manifest is committed before the first run that
reports it, and no case of it is edited after a run. Once any run names the set, whether reported under
docs/evaluation/runs/ or kept under data/evaluation/runs/, a redraw only rebuilds it: its cases are kept when they are
the ones the committed manifest describes, and the manifest is never rewritten, so a clone can rebuild the set from
the snapshot (OPS-07) and no one can change it under its name. A play is refused unless the set is the one its
committed manifest describes, so an edited case can't play under the set's name. A changed held-out set is a new
version, drawn under a new name, with earlier results reported against the old one.

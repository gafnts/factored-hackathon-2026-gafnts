"""
A set played in process on a machine that holds the snapshot (ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-01): each case through
the player over the tools' items for its customer, a development set's with the scripted models or the deterministic
baseline's, and the held-out set's with the baseline's alone (ADR-0005, Baselines), graded, and its evidence and grade kept under data/evaluation/runs/<run>/, never committed, since
both hold the case's values (SEC-03). The summary holds counts, and the findings no open disagreement entry matches by
situation and check only, so it can be printed. The run's manifest says what ran (ADR-0005, The run manifest): no
provider and no latency, since no model runs and the network is skipped, and a cost of zero.

"""
The judge's rubric (ADR-0005, Grading; EVL-10): typed questions for what code can't compare, each citing the rules
that require it, read from rubric.json. A question is a choice, a yes or no, or a score; code decides which questions
a reply's turn calls for (applies), and which answer passes (passes), so the judge never sees what we expect. Every
answer carries the judge's confidence, and the levels in `by_hand` send the judgment to a person. The bar a question
must clear before the judge grades it is fixed here, with the version, before any grading. `problems()` lists every
way the file breaks these rules; the tests require it to find none.

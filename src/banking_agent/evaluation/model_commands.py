"""
The commands that call models outside the system under test, and the judge's validation, which __main__ adds to its
own. judge has Claude Opus 5.5 grade a run's replies, or a sample's, through the batch API, keeping its items,
attempts, judgments, and manifest under data/evaluation/judge/. judge-sample draws the blind sample and its sheet from
a run's replies, and judge-agreement scores a judge run against the filled sheet; neither calls a model. router
compares the registered router candidates on one side of the family split, keeping its readings, errors, calls, and
report under data/evaluation/router/. With --estimate a command prices its calls and makes none; otherwise it reads the
Anthropic key from the env file, as the live language check does, and sends it to the client only. Each prints
counts, never a reply, a value, or the key (SEC-03).

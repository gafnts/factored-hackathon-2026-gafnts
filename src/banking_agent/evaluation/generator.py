"""
The generator (ADR-0005, Coverage and size): draws a set's cases for one side of the split from bronze, the side's
families and answers, and a seed, and gives each the oracle's expected outcome. A situation is a state the policy
reads (a credit card over its limit, a decline with no code) with the families that ask about it and the answers the
scripted customer gives; candidates come from one query over the side's customers, and a candidate counts only when the
oracle's path is the one the situation means. The same snapshot, families, commit, and seed give the same set.

A built situation adds fixtures to a customer who lacks it, and a situation short of natural customers can be topped up
with built ones; a fault situation adds a plan that fails one tool (ADR-0005's amendment of 2026-10-01).

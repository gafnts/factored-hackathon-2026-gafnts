"""
Label quality (DML-08, EVL-08; ADR-0005, Grading, Labels): 50 of the families' messages relabeled by hand, blind to
the labels their families carry, and the agreement reported. relabel-sample draws the sheet, stratified over the
request groups and alternating the languages, from every family on both sides of the split, since the labels under
test are the families' own; the person reads the policy's request list first and writes every request the message
makes, or none. relabel-agreement scores the filled sheet: exact agreement on the set of labels with a Wilson
interval, Cohen's kappa on the first label with a bootstrap interval, and the disagreements by row for the policy's
text to settle, a message dropped when it can't (ADR-0005). The files hold message IDs and labels, never a text but
the sheet's own (SEC-03).

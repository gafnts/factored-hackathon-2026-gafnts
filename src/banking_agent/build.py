"""
Builds what Terraform deploys into build/ (ADR-0004, Deployment): a zip each for the Runtime and the Lambdas, with this
package and the Linux arm64 wheels its dependency group locks in uv.lock. Every zip is the same bytes on every machine,
so a plan shows a change only when the code or a locked version changed. The Runtime's entry script names the commit
that last changed the packaged code, which the execution record stamps on every turn. It also rewrites the Gateway's
tool definitions, which are committed so that CI can lint the stack without a build.

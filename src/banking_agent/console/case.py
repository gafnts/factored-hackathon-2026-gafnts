"""
One case, found by its reference (ADR-0007's amendments of 2026-09-30): the reference's own item, then the case, both
read strongly consistent, so a case filed a moment ago is found at once. A draft holds no reference, and an evaluation's
case reads as no case at all (EVL-13). The calls come from the turns the case names in its record, read with a tool
call's attributes only, all the case Lambda's role may name, so no message, reply, or model output reaches the console
(CTL-05). Of each call, the console gets what the record holds about it and the rows of its result that the case's facts
and actions name, read as file_handoff read them when it checked the case (OPS-02).
